## Overview

This project is an Image Caption Generation application that allows users to upload images and receive a caption describing the content of the image. The backend is powered by a machine learning model that processes the uploaded image and generates a caption. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the system.

### Key Features:
- Upload an image from the frontend.
- Receive AI-generated captions for the uploaded image.
- Simple user authentication and logout functionality.
- Responsive, modern user interface with smooth animations.
